# Sudoku Solver Usign Genethic Algorithm (GA)

This study aims to evaluate the influences and the performance of different approaches, algorithms, and genetic operators to solve the resolution of any sudoku puzzle with Genetic Algorithm and documenting the results obtained. The two objectives of this study were to explore and test the usefulness and efficiency of genetic algorithms to address this constraint satisfaction problem through the utilization of a wide set of techniques and the second objective is to explore how problems that are considered difficult for a human solver are also difficult for the genetic algorithm validated through the testing of multiples level of difficulties.

## How to run the program?

1. The program must be run using the file run.py

2. The folder data must exist on your local directory to be able to run the program

3. At the end the process the program generates an statisticall summary of the timing of the resolution likewise print some images with the fitness landscape throughout the generations per complexity


## What does the program do?
### 1. Scrap the data
   1.1 Download the data from internet

   1.2 Save the data into the "data" folder

### 2. Load the data
### 3. Solve the Set of Puzzles
   3.1. Run GA algorithms (Crossover, Mutation)
   
   3.2. Choose solutions according to the type of maximization or miminization
   
   3.3. Update statistically summary
   
   3.4. Print solutions per generation

### 4. Post-Processing
   4.1. Plotting the fitness landscape per generation
   
   4.2. The images will be saved into the 'data' folder
